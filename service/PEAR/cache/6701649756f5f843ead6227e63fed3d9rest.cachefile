It is ideal for storing all of the CSS in a single location and allowing it to be parsed as needed at runtime (or from cache) using both general and browser filters specified in the attribute for the style tags. It can be driven with either the libxslt pear extenstion (part of xmldom) or the xslt extension (part of the sablotron libraries).
My hope is that such a system becomes the standard for the organization of stylesheet information in the future.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:17:"/rest/r/xml_cssml";}}}
