**WARNING**:
To use the web interface, you must set PEAR's data_dir to a subdirectory of
document root.

If browsing to http://localhost/index.php displays /path/to/htdocs/index.php,
set data_dir to a subdirectory of /path/to/htdocs:

$ pear config-set data_dir /path/to/htdocs/pear
$ pear install PhpDocumentor
