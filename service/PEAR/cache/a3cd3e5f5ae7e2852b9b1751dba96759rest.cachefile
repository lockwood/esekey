By convention F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1.
An alternative formula that uses the Golden Ratio can also be used:
      F(n) = (PHI^n - phi^n)/sqrt(5) [Lucas' formula],
where PHI = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is the Golden Ratio, and
      phi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 is its reciprocal

the BCMATH libraries are present.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:22:"/rest/r/math_fibonacci";}}}
