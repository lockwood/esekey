Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:33:"/rest/r/html_quickform_controller";}}}
