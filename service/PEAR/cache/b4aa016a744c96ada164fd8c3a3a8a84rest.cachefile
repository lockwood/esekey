a) a drop in replacement for the XML_Wddx extension (if it's not built in)
b) produce an editable wddx file (with indenting etc.) and uses CDATA, rather than char tags
This package contains 2 static method:
XML_Wddx:serialize($value)
XML_Wddx:deserialize($value)
should be 90% compatible with wddx_deserialize(), and the deserializer will use wddx_deserialize if it is built in..
No support for recordsets is available at present in the PHP version of the deserializer.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:16:"/rest/r/xml_wddx";}}}
