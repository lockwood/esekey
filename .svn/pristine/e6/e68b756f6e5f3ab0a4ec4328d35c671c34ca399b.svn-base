If you wish to change an image in the Gallery, or if you wish to add a new entry to the Gallery, you will first need to 
upload the required image from your computer to your site storage on the EseSite&trade; server. 
To do this, follow the instructions described in the section 
<a href="#" onClick="top.Top.GoToURL('EseInfo', 'Uploading an Image', 'esesiteimg.html?')"
            onMouseOver="return window.status='EseInfo&trade; &gt; Uploading an Image';"
            onMouseOut="return window.status='';">Uploading an Image</a>. 
                  </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
			      <td class="infoalt1-step">2</td>
                  <td class="infoalt1-left">
To update an existing Gallery entry, go the Gallery List and in the Action column, click on the "Edit" link for the 
exhibit you wish to change.  
                  </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
			      <td class="infoalt2-step">3</td>
                  <td class="infoalt2-left">
To change the text in the Gallery exhibit, look in the area to the right of the label "Exhibit". Type your changes 
in the text field, overtyping existing text if necessary. At any time, if you wish to abandon the changes you have 
typed, click on the "&lt;&lt;Back" button. You will get a message that indicates that some unsaved changes may have been made.  
Click "OK" to confirm that you wish to abandon your changes, or "Cancel" to continue with your existing updates.    
                  </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
			      <td class="infoalt1-step">4</td>
                  <td class="infoalt1-left">
If you wish to change the image specified in the selected Gallery exhibit, click on the drop down button to the right of the 
label "Image". You will be presented with a list of all images that are currently loaded in your site storage on 
the EseSite&trade; server. Select the image you wish to use from this list.
                  </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
			      <td class="infoalt2-step">5</td>
                  <td class="infoalt2-left">
When you have finished updating the Gallery exhibit, click the Update button. The 
message "Record Successfully Updated" will appear, confirming that
you have successfully saved your changes. Click OK to remove the message. 
                  </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
			      <td class="infoalt1-step">6</td>
                  <td class="infoalt1-left">
To add a new exhibit to the Gallery, go the Gallery List and at the bottom right, click on the "Add New" button. 
As in steps 3 and 4 above, you will need to type in the text that describes the new exhibit, and select the new 
image from the dropdown list. You must also click on the "Active" checkbox (to tick the box) if you want the new 
exhibit to appear on the site straight away. This checkbox can also be used to temporarily remove an existing 
exhibit from the Gallery, by removing the tick in the box (telling the system that this exhibit is NOT active).
Finally, click the "Add" button when you have finished setting up your new exhibit.
