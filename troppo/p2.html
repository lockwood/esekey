           </p>            <b>Welcome</b> to <b><a href="p7.html">Wisteria</a>, <a href="p8.html">Gardener's Bothy</a></b> and <b><a href="p9.html">The Smithy</a></b>, our <b>Dorney Self Catering Apartments </b>in a unique location. <br>The apartments are set in the grounds of a Tudor house in a rural, peaceful location in the village of Dorney. The River Thames and Boveney Lock are a short stroll away and Windsor and Eton are less than three miles from Dorney. Maidenhead, Bray, Cookham, Bourne End and Henley are within half an hour's drive or less and Beaconsfield and Oxford are within easy reach by car. If you plan to visit London we suggest you take the train from Slough station to Paddington where the underground trains or buses will take you directly to the centre in less than an hour.  This is the perfect place to stay if you plan a visit to Legoland. We recommend a car for the duration of your stay.<br/>
<br/>Each of our apartments can accommodate singles, couples or a family, and when combined they can be block-booked by groups of up to 16 people.<br><br>           <table align="center">
