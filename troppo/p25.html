DORNEY SELF CATERING APARTMENTS MAY 2008<br/><br/>
SELF CATERING APARTMENTS: GARDENERS BOTHY, WISTERIA and THE SMITHY<br/><br/>
INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>
This access statement describes our current facilities and services offered to our guests.  This will enable potential guests to make an informed decision with regard to our flats and facilities.  It also helps them decide about their particular needs.<br/><br/>
It falls within the requirement of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995 revised 2005) (DDA).  This access statement is a mandatory part of the quality assessment process for Visit Britain (Star Rating), but it also helps with specific access issues, decision making for potential guests, and legal obligations within the DDA (see above).<br/><br/>
This access statement is placed on our website, is available within the information folder in each apartment and is available on demand from any of our staff.<br/><br/>
It may be faxed to you, emailed or posted.<br/><br/>
Dorney Self Catering Apartments comprises three separate self catering apartments, within one building, that was originally built as part of The Old Place, Boveney.<br/><br/>
The building dates back to 1905, is red brick construction with tiled roof.  Gardeners Bothy takes up the whole of the loft conversion on the first floor.  The Smithy is to the rear of the building and Wisteria is to the front of the building.  Wisteria is a conversion of the original coach house.<br/><br/>
The Smithy and Wisteria are on the ground floor with no steps up to the entrance but with a threshold in each case.<br/><br/>
Dorney Self Catering Apartments offers practical accommodation for families, who may use “sofa beds”.  The star rating from Visit Britain is based on the accommodation of the number of bed places, which is of course, much less than the wider facility of sofa beds.<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>Secure rural environment</li>
<li>Open garden areas for sitting out and playing games</li>
<li>Variety of livestock (geese, chickens etc)</li>
