Your EseSite&trade; website is your marketing brochure on the Internet. In addition to showing availability
and taking bookings, your website is there to present the key features of your accommodation and 
services for viewing by the general public - which means internet surfers world-wide! 
This overview describes how your website is built up using EseSite, and how it all fits together.
<p>The structure of an EseSite website is a simple hierarchy that allows you to organise
the information and link it together in a similar way to a printed brochure. 
The EseSite hierarchy consists of three types of components: Sections, Pages and Elements. 
Navigation around the site and the organisation of the page content is determined by the relationships
that are defined between the individual components.</p>
<p>The top level unit in an EseSite website is a Section. There must be at least one Section in the 
site, as Pages are only viewable if they are included in an active Section. 
Each Section has a Page list which may contain one or more Pages. The Page is 
the component that defines an individually browsable web page. Each Page has an Element list which may
contain one or more Elements. The Element is the bottom level component that 
defines a chunk of information to be viewed on the Page, much like a paragraph in a brochure. 
An Element may be just text, just an image, text
with an image or, for the more ambitious, a block of hypertext markup language (HTML).  
</p>
<p>The components described above take care of the content and the navigation of the site; the look and feel and 
the physical page layouts are managed by the style sheet and the page template, which are not currently accessible
from the Administration Console. If you wish to make minor changes to these, this can be done at no cost - please call 07860 832741 or email 
<a href="mailto:support@esekey.com">support@esekey.com</a> with details of the changes you require. For major 
changes, such as a relaunch of the site with a new look, or a significant change in page layout, there will be a fee.
