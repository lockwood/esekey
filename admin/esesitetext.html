To update existing content on a page of your site, first you must find the location of the content 
that you want to update. The content will be located in one or more Elements.
You can find the Element(s) either by scanning the Element List until you find the content, or by scanning
the Page Element List and noting down the numbers (IDs) of the Elements that appear on the page you wish to
update. You can find out the number of the page that you wish to update by navigating to that page on
your website and looking at the address (URL) of the page in your browser. For example, if the page you
want to update is at http://www.yoursite.com/p8.html, then you are looking for Elements that appear on page 
number (ID) 8.

			      <td class="infoalt1-step">2</td>
                  <td class="infoalt1-left">
Edit the required Element(s). In the Action column of the Element List, click on the "Edit" link for the
Element you wish to change. 
                  </td>
            </tr>

			      <td class="infoalt2-step">3</td>
                  <td class="infoalt2-left">
To change the text in the Element, look in the area to the right of the label "Text". Type any required changes in the
text area, overtyping existing text if necessary. At any time, if you wish to abandon the changes you have typed, click
on the "&lt;&lt;Back" button. You will get a message that indicates that some unsaved changes may have been made.  
Click "OK" to confirm that you wish to abandon your changes, or "Cancel" to continue with your existing updates.

                  <td class="infoalt1-left">
If you wish to change the image specified in the selected Element, click on the drop down button to the right of the 
label "Image". You will be presented with a list of all images that are currently loaded in your site storage on 
the EseSite&trade; server. Select the image you wish to use from this list. If you have not already done so, you may 
need to upload a new image onto the server from your computer. To do this, follow the instructions described in the section 
<a href="#" onClick="top.Top.GoToURL('EseInfo', 'Uploading an Image', 'esesiteimg.html?')"
            onMouseOver="return window.status='EseInfo&trade; &gt; Uploading an Image';"

                  <td class="infoalt2-left">
If you wish to change the position of an image in relation to its text as specified in the selected Element, 
click on the drop down button to the right of the label "Element Type". You will be presented with a list of options:  
---None--- is the default value. If you select 'left', the image will display to the left, and the text to the right. 
If you select 'right', the image will display to the right, and the text to the left. If you select 'top',
the image will be centred at the top of the element with the text shown below it. 
                  </td>

When you have finished updating the content, click the Update button. The 
message "Record Successfully Updated", followed by (for example) "p8.html created" will appear, confirming that
you have successfully saved your changes. Click OK to remove the message.
